//! The authentication state machine.
//!
//! The core never speaks OIDC. `beam-server` is a confidential client in the
//! backend-for-frontend pattern ([ADR-0003]) and FR-107 is explicit that a
//! client must not invoke an OIDC library of its own, so the whole exchange
//! happens server-side and the client's only credential is the opaque
//! `beam_session` cookie.
//!
//! Getting that cookie onto a phone is the awkward part. `sanitize_redirect_path`
//! in `beam-auth` accepts only same-origin relative paths, so the server
//! cannot be asked to redirect to a custom scheme, and there is no native
//! token endpoint. The flow therefore runs in an in-app browser and the
//! cookie is lifted from its jar -- the foreign side's job. Everything after
//! that point is here, and is a pure state machine so it can be tested
//! exhaustively without a network or a WebView.
