//! the `BeamSession` scheme -- an API key in the `beam_session` cookie -- and
//! the generated client attaches a registered credential of that scheme as
//! `Cookie: beam_session=<value>` on every operation that requires it. The
//! façade registers one `Credential::Provider` under that name at install and
//! never replaces it; the provider reads whatever cookie the server currently
//! holds, so the credential has exactly one owner and this module never sees
//! it.
//!
//! What is left for a [`Middleware`] is what only the response can tell: a
//! mid-session 401, observable in one place instead of at every call site, and
//! the problem document a failed response carried, handed back to the call
//! that made it.
