# Security Architecture

`beam-server` authenticates users via OIDC in the backend-for-frontend (BFF) pattern: the *server*
holds the OIDC client credentials and performs the Authorization Code + PKCE exchange; the browser
never sees an ID, access, or refresh token. The browser holds exactly one credential — the
`beam_session` httpOnly, `SameSite=Lax` cookie — for everything, including video playback. See
[ADR-0003](decisions/ADR-0003-oidc-bff-auth.md) for why OIDC/BFF and
[ADR-0005](decisions/ADR-0005-sessions-in-postgres.md) for why sessions live in Postgres.

## OIDC / BFF flow

1. **Login.** `GET /v1/auth/login` generates a PKCE verifier/challenge, `state`, and nonce, stores
   them in the single-use `pending_auths` table (see `data-model.md`), and redirects the browser to
   the configured issuer's authorization endpoint.
2. **IdP authentication.** The user authenticates at the IdP (dev: the opt-in Dex behind the
   `dev-idp` compose profile, started by `mise run dev:up`; prod: any OIDC-compliant IdP —
   Keycloak, Authentik, Authelia, a hosted provider). The IdP redirects back with an authorization
   code.
3. **Callback.** `GET /v1/auth/callback` consumes the `pending_auths` row atomically (a `state`
   value is exchangeable at most once), exchanges code + PKCE verifier for tokens server-to-server
   (via the `openidconnect` crate), and validates the ID token's issuer, audience, signature, nonce,
   and expiry.
4. **JIT provisioning.** A `users` row is looked up (or created) by `(oidc_issuer, oidc_subject)` —
   there is no separate registration step. `is_admin` is recomputed here from the allowlist (below).
5. **Session creation.** An opaque, high-entropy token is generated; only its SHA-256 hash is stored
   in `sessions`; the cookie is set `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` per the resolution rules
   below. The IdP tokens are discarded — `beam-server` never talks to the IdP again mid-session.
6. **Subsequent requests.** Middleware hashes the presented cookie value, looks it up by
   `token_hash`, checks expiry, slides the idle expiry forward, and attaches the resolved user to
   the request. No token ever appears in a URL, query string, or `<video>` `src`.
7. **Logout.** `POST /v1/logout` deletes the session row server-side (so a stolen cookie value is
   useless after logout) and clears the cookie; `POST /v1/logout-all` and
   `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}` revoke other sessions.

## Session model

- **Hashed at rest:** only `SHA-256(token)` is stored; a database dump does not expose usable
  sessions.
- **Two-tier expiry:** `idle_expires_at` slides forward on activity (`BEAM_SESSION_IDLE_DAYS`,
  default 14) up to the hard `absolute_expires_at` ceiling (`BEAM_SESSION_MAX_DAYS`, default 60),
  which never extends.
- **Server-side revocation:** revoking a session is a row delete — no JWT expiry windows or
  denylists. The cookie carries only an opaque token, never a signed claim bundle, sidestepping the
  JWT pitfall class (algorithm confusion, secret rotation, forgery on key leak) entirely.

## Cookie `Secure` resolution

The cookie's `Secure` flag defaults to whatever `BEAM_SERVER_URL`'s scheme implies (`https://` →
secure). If other configuration implies an HTTPS deployment (`BEAM_WEB_URL` or
`BEAM_EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` contain `https://`) while cookies resolve insecure and no explicit
override is set, **startup fails with an error** rather than silently issuing an insecure session
cookie on an HTTPS deployment. Setting `BEAM_COOKIE_SECURE=false` explicitly is the escape hatch
for topologies where the heuristic is wrong (e.g. TLS terminated in front of a plain-HTTP origin);
it downgrades the error to a logged warning.

## CSRF model

Two deliberate layers protect cookie-authenticated state changes:

- `SameSite=Lax` is the primary defense — the browser does not attach the cookie to cross-site
  POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests at all.
- The `/v1` router additionally enforces same-origin on every unsafe method: a request presenting
  an `Origin` (or `Referer`, as fallback) that doesn't match `BEAM_WEB_URL`, `BEAM_SERVER_URL`, or
  `BEAM_EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is rejected with `403` before reaching a handler. Requests with
  neither header pass — legitimate non-browser clients send neither and never carry the cookie,
  while SameSite already stops the browser-based attack.

## Admin gating

`is_admin` is derived **solely** from a claim the IdP asserts in the verified ID token — the IdP is
the single, auditable authority (issue #85). An env-var email allowlist was deliberately removed:
trusting the IdP alone keeps the admin attack surface minimal to audit, with no server-side
side-channel grant to reconcile. `BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_CLAIM` names the claim (e.g. `groups`) and
`BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_VALUE` the expected value (boolean `true` when unset; otherwise a string equality
or array-contains match — see `../operations/configuration.md`).

Admin is recomputed and written to the `users` row at **every** login, so it both grants and
revokes: removing the claim at the IdP demotes the user at their next login, and with
`BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_CLAIM` unset nobody is admin at all. There is intentionally no manual admin toggle —
a later admin UI displays the flag read-only. All admin mutations (library management, re-enrichment,
log viewing, the admin event stream) route through one shared admin-gating check.

## Read-only media filesystem as a security boundary

The media library is mounted read-only, as a hard architectural invariant: even a worst-case
path-traversal bug in file-serving code cannot modify or delete library content. The server's own
writable storage (`BEAM_DATA_DIR`) is a separate location; nothing about playback or indexing writes
into the library tree. The API reinforces the boundary at another layer: clients only ever see
opaque IDs (`fileId`, `movieId`), never filesystem paths — every resource reference is resolved
server-side against the catalog. The AdminAuth-gated operational surface is a sanctioned exemption
(NFR-108): admin events, the admin event stream and the admin log carry the configured root path so
that the operator can fix it. Nothing there is a resource reference — no request path is ever
resolved from a client-supplied string.

One endpoint escapes both the rule and that exemption: `getLibraryFiles`
(`GET /v1/libraries/{id}/files`) is `SessionAuth`, so it hands `LibraryFile.path` to any signed-in
user rather than to an admin. It is tracked as [#168](https://github.com/justin13888/Beam/issues/168)
and is named here because a reader checking this section against the server would otherwise find it
contradicted — the opaque-ID claim above describes the intent and every other surface, not that one.

## Operational hardening

- Startup logs redact secrets: `ServerConfig` has a hand-written `Debug` impl that redacts
  credential fields, and destructures all fields so adding a config field without classifying it is
  a compile error.
- Request handlers return `500` instead of panicking when expected injected state is missing —
  a wiring bug degrades one request, not the process.
- Rate limiting: in-process token buckets (see `beam-server/src/routes/rate_limit.rs`) guard the auth
  endpoints (`/v1/auth/login`, `/v1/auth/callback`) and the browse/search endpoint (`GET /v1/media`),
  keyed per client IP, returning `429` with a `Retry-After` header when exceeded. Streaming/download
  paths are excluded on purpose. Enforced since [#69](https://github.com/justin13888/beam/issues/69);
  tunable via `BEAM_RATE_LIMIT_*` (see [configuration](../operations/configuration.md)).

## Threat model notes

**Why a cookie works for the `<video>` tag.** Range-request fetches from a player are subresource
requests: the browser attaches the httpOnly cookie without ever exposing it to page JavaScript.
Beam's deployment model is same-site in dev (different ports on `localhost`) and same-origin in prod
(one reverse-proxy origin), so the cookie is reliably attached to media requests — no query-string
token workaround is needed, and none exists. A cross-site embed of Beam's `<video>` on a third-party
page does not receive the cookie under `SameSite=Lax`, which is accepted: Beam's media is not meant
to be hotlinked.

**No server-side transcoding narrows the attack surface.** The playback path is a plain byte-range
file server — no external process invocation with attacker-influenceable inputs. See
[ADR-0004](decisions/ADR-0004-never-transcode.md).

**Artwork does not leave the deployment.** Poster and backdrop URLs are Beam's own
`/v1/artwork` paths: the server fetches each image from the provider once and serves it from its
cache, so no viewer's client contacts TMDB or AniList and neither CDN can observe who is browsing
what ([ADR-0015](decisions/ADR-0015-artwork-served-by-beam.md), NFR-501). This replaces the
residual risk [ADR-0008](decisions/ADR-0008-image-cdn-direct.md) accepted.

**The artwork endpoint is not an open proxy.** The only URL it will fetch is one enrichment itself
wrote onto a row; a client sends a title id and two enum variants, never a URL, so there is no
allowlist to maintain and no bypass to find. The outbound fetch additionally refuses anything that
is not `https`, will not follow a redirect off `https`, refuses an over-large body before reading
it, accepts only image content types, and carries no Beam credential (NFR-502) — the client is
built with no cookie jar, so there is nowhere for the session cookie to be attached from.

**Why a cookie works for an `<img>` tag.** The same reason it works for `<video>` above: artwork is
a subresource request, and every supported deployment is same-site, so `SameSite=Lax` attaches the
session cookie without it ever reaching page JavaScript.
