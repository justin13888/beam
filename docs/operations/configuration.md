# Configuration

All Beam configuration is environment variables. `beam-server/src/config.rs` is the single
authority for server variable names, defaults, and semantics — this document mirrors it; if they
ever disagree, `config.rs` wins and this file has a bug.

`beam-server` loads a `.env` file if present (via `dotenvy`) and then the process environment.
In compose deployments, variables flow from the repo-root `.env` through the list-form
`environment:` block in `compose.beam.yaml`. That list form is deliberate: an *unset* variable
must arrive inside the container as genuinely absent, not as an empty string — for optional
settings like `BEAM_OIDC_ISSUER`, an explicitly empty value would parse as "set to empty" and,
for example, make the server believe OIDC is configured against an empty issuer URL. Leave
optional variables unset/commented rather than blank.

## beam-server

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BEAM_BIND_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0:8000` | Address the HTTP server binds. |
| `BEAM_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Externally-visible base URL of the server. Drives the OIDC redirect URL (`<BEAM_SERVER_URL>/v1/auth/callback`) and the cookie-`Secure` heuristic. Use the public HTTPS URL in production. |
| `BEAM_DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://beam:password@localhost:5432/beam` | Postgres connection string. |
| `BEAM_AUTO_MIGRATE` | `true` | Apply pending schema migrations at startup. Set `false` for operator-managed migrations via the `beam-migration` CLI. |
| `BEAM_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `20` | Maximum size of the Postgres connection pool. |
| `BEAM_DB_MIN_CONNECTIONS` | `5` | Connections the pool keeps open even when idle. |
| `BEAM_VIDEO_DIR` | `./videos` | Read-only root of the media library. Must exist at startup; libraries are created at paths under it. |
| `BEAM_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Server-writable state directory (created if missing). Treat as data worth backing up, not a disposable cache. |
| `BEAM_ENABLE_METRICS` | `false` | Install the Prometheus metrics recorder and expose `GET /metrics` (top-level, outside `/v1`) in the Prometheus text format: HTTP request counts and durations per route class, plus indexing/enrichment counters. The endpoint is **unauthenticated** — it is only as reachable as `BEAM_BIND_ADDRESS`, so keep that internal (the supported reverse-proxy topology does not forward `/metrics`). When `false`, neither the endpoint nor the request-metrics middleware is mounted. |
| `BEAM_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `30` | How long a graceful shutdown (ctrl-c/SIGTERM) waits for in-flight requests to drain before exiting anyway. |
| `BEAM_HASH_UNKNOWN_FILES` | `true` | Hash files with unknown extensions during indexing so duplicate detection covers every file; disable to save scan IO. |
| `BEAM_SCAN_INTERVAL_SECS` | `3600` | Interval between periodic full library rescans (backstop for anything the watcher missed). |
| `BEAM_WATCH_ENABLED` | `true` | Run the inotify filesystem watcher for near-real-time index updates. |
| `BEAM_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `2000` | Debounce window for watcher events on the same path. |
| `BEAM_ENRICH_INTERVAL_SECS` | `300` | Interval between metadata-enrichment sweeps (new titles are also swept immediately when queued). |
| `BEAM_ENRICH_BATCH_SIZE` | `25` | Maximum titles processed per enrichment sweep. Larger batches drain a backlog faster but lengthen each sweep and lean harder on provider rate limits. Must be ≥ 1. |
| `BEAM_ENRICH_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `0.7` | Minimum overall match confidence, in `(0.0, 1.0]`, a candidate must reach before its metadata is applied. Higher is stricter (fewer false matches, more titles left un-enriched). |
| `BEAM_TMDB_API_TOKEN` | unset | TMDB read-access token for `cameo` enrichment. Absent → TMDB-eligible titles are left un-enriched (never fails a scan). |
| `BEAM_ANILIST_ENABLED` | `true` | Toggle AniList-sourced enrichment (needs no token). |
| `BEAM_METADATA_LANGUAGE` | unset | Preferred metadata language as a BCP-47 tag, e.g. `en` or `en-US` (lowercase language, uppercase region). Affects TMDB only — AniList has no language concept. Unset or empty → the provider's default. An invalid tag **fails startup** with an error naming the bad tag (an explicitly-set knob is never silently ignored; leaving it unset keeps the graceful warn-and-disable behavior for other cameo build failures). |
| `BEAM_ARTWORK_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` | `1073741824` | Ceiling for the on-disk artwork cache under `BEAM_DATA_DIR/artwork`. Past it, the least recently served images are deleted. Sizing it below a library's artwork costs re-fetches, never correctness. |
| `BEAM_ARTWORK_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `10` | How long to wait on a provider CDN for one image. |
| `BEAM_ARTWORK_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` | `16777216` | Largest single image accepted from a provider; a larger response is refused rather than buffered. |
| `BEAM_ARTWORK_NEGATIVE_TTL_SECS` | `300` | How long a failed artwork fetch is remembered, so a provider that is down (or art deleted upstream) is not re-requested once per client per grid render. |
| `BEAM_OIDC_ISSUER` | unset | OIDC issuer URL. All three `BEAM_OIDC_*` values are required together; until then login is disabled with a clear error (not a crash). |
| `BEAM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | unset | OIDC client id registered with the IdP. |
| `BEAM_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | OIDC client secret. Secret — never logged (startup config logging redacts it). |
| `BEAM_OIDC_SCOPES` | `openid profile email` | Space-separated scopes requested at login. |
| `BEAM_WEB_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | Web client origin: OIDC success redirect target and an implicitly allowed CSRF Origin. The default suits a host-run server against the Vite dev server; the compose stack overrides it to `http://localhost:8080`, where the containerized web client is served. Running Vite on `:5173` against a containerized server therefore needs `BEAM_EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173`, or writes are rejected with 403 while reads still succeed. |
| `BEAM_EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | unset | Comma-separated extra Origins accepted on state-changing requests. |
| `BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_CLAIM` | unset | Name of an ID-token claim the IdP asserts to grant admin (e.g. `groups`). Admin is derived **solely** from this claim, recomputed on every login. **Unset → nobody is admin, and any existing admin is demoted at their next login.** An empty value is treated as unset. |
| `BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_VALUE` | unset | Expected value for `BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_CLAIM`. Unset → the claim must assert boolean `true` (a stringified `"true"` is also accepted). Set → admin is granted when the claim is a string equal to this value **or** an array containing it (case-sensitive; covers a `groups` claim). Setting this while `BEAM_OIDC_ADMIN_CLAIM` is unset **fails startup**. |
| `BEAM_COOKIE_SECURE` | unset (derived) | Whether auth cookies are marked `Secure`. Unset → derived from `BEAM_SERVER_URL`'s scheme. If other configured origins imply HTTPS while cookies would resolve insecure and this is unset, **the server refuses to start**; set it explicitly (`true` for TLS-terminating proxies in front of a plain-HTTP origin, `false` only if you genuinely want insecure cookies — loudly warned). |
| `BEAM_SESSION_IDLE_DAYS` | `14` | Session idle timeout (slides forward on activity, capped by the absolute lifetime). |
| `BEAM_SESSION_MAX_DAYS` | `60` | Absolute session lifetime. |
| `BEAM_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether the in-process rate limiter is installed on the auth and search endpoints (NFR-107). When `false`, no limiter middleware is mounted at all. |
| `BEAM_RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_MINUTE` | `10` | Sustained request rate — and burst — per client for `/v1/auth/login` and `/v1/auth/callback`, in requests/minute. Must be ≥ 1. |
| `BEAM_RATE_LIMIT_SEARCH_PER_MINUTE` | `60` | Sustained request rate — and burst — per client for `GET /v1/media` (browse/search), in requests/minute. Must be ≥ 1. |
| `BEAM_RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR` | `false` | Whether to key the rate limiter off the first `X-Forwarded-For` IP instead of the peer socket IP. Only enable behind a trusted proxy that overwrites the header — it is otherwise trivially spoofable. |
| `RUST_LOG` | (tracing default) | Standard `tracing` filter, e.g. `beam_server=info`. |

## beam-web (build-time)

Vite inlines these into the static bundle at build time (compose passes them as build args):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `C_APP_TITLE` | `Beam` | Application title shown in the UI. |
| `C_STREAM_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | URL the **browser** uses to reach the API server; match `BEAM_SERVER_URL` as seen from outside. |

The `C_` prefix is deliberate and must stay distinct from `BEAM_`: Vite inlines **every**
environment variable matching its configured client prefix into the public JavaScript bundle
(`beam-web/vite.config.ts`, `beam-web/src/env.ts`). If the client shared the `BEAM_` prefix, a
build machine with `BEAM_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` in its environment would ship that secret to every
browser.

## Compose-only variables

Read by the compose files, not by application code:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` | `beam` / `password` / `beam` | Postgres bootstrap credentials; keep in sync with `BEAM_DATABASE_URL`. Change the password in production. |
| `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` | `5432` | Host port for Postgres. |
| `BEAM_SERVER_HOST_PORT` | `8000` | Host port for the API server. |
| `WEB_HOST_PORT` | `8080` | Host port for the web app. |
| `TRAEFIK_HTTP_PORT` / `TRAEFIK_HTTPS_PORT` / `TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD_PORT` | `80` / `443` / `8888` | Traefik entrypoints (dashboard is loopback-only). |
| `HOST_VIDEO_DIR` | `server_videos` named volume | Host path mounted read-only at `BEAM_VIDEO_DIR`. |
| `HOST_DATA_DIR` | `server_data` named volume | Host path mounted at `BEAM_DATA_DIR`. |

## Task-only variables

Read by the `mise` tasks, not by the compose files or by application code:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BEAM_COMPOSE` | `podman compose` if `podman` is on `PATH`, else `docker compose` | Container runtime the `dev:*` mise tasks drive. Set it (e.g. `docker compose`) when both are installed but only one is usable. |
| `BEAM_CONTAINER` | `docker` if it is on `PATH`, else `podman` | Image builder `check:ffmpeg-build` drives. Prefers `docker` -- the reverse of `BEAM_COMPOSE` -- so that where both exist the gate exercises the same `docker buildx build` the release workflow publishes with. |
| `BEAM_CONTAINER_CACHE_DIR` | unset (no layer cache) | Directory for buildx's local layer cache in `check:ffmpeg-build`. CI points it at a cached path. Honoured only when the engine's build driver can export a cache, which the task probes with `buildx inspect`: the stock `docker` driver cannot (create a container-driver builder with `docker buildx create --use`; CI gets one from `docker/setup-buildx-action`), and podman cannot either -- its `--cache-to` takes a registry reference, not a buildx `type=local` exporter, so it relies on its own layer cache instead. When the cache cannot be honoured the task warns and builds uncached locally, but **exits non-zero if `CI` is set**: in CI a warning on a green job is unreadable, and silently paying for a full FFmpeg compile every run must not look like success. |

## Validation

Run [`verify-config.sh`](../../verify-config.sh) from the repo root after editing `.env`: it
checks required variables, the all-or-none `BEAM_OIDC_*` rule, and mirrors the server's
cookie-Secure startup refusal, without echoing secret values.
